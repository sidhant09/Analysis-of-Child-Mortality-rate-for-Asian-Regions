# Analysis-of-Child-Mortality-rate-for-Asian-Regions

All the members of the World Health Organization (WHO) made a promise to reduce the child mortality rate of their respective countries by 2/3rd between the period 1990 to 2015. This pact undertaken by the WHO member countries is known as the Millennium Development Goal (MDG-4).

In this project we take into account the Asian countries by putting them in certain regions and then collectively analyze their decrease in mortality rate in the period 1990 to 2015.
We mainly take into account the largest populations of the Asian continent i.e. India and China and critically analyze their progress towards reducing child mortality rate from 1990 to 2015. 

# Data
The data was collected from http://data.unicef.org/child-mortality/under-five.html.

# Implementation
We have used  python packages such as matplotlib, nvd3, plotly and pandas for data selection and data visualization process.
